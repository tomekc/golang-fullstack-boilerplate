# Golang Self Contained App Boilerplate

## Modes of operation

### Production

The production-built frontend code is embedded to Go binary: the program is totally self-contained.

### Development

You want to run front-end in dev mode for auto reloading.

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
